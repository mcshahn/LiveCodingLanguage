  <p>This is an almost minimal command-based live coding engine. Press the button to re-evaluate your code.
    This language allows you to specify a rhythmic pattern of beats by entering a space-separated list of times and pitches. 
    You can also include javascript computation in the values.

    New feature added: change oscillator by adding oscillator type at end of the code. Please make sure to add a space between the notes description and the oscillator type.
    If the oscillator type isn't implemented in web audio, the sounds from the previously selected oscillator will continue to play.
